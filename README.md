## Introduction
Simon Says is a fun and interactive memory game that challenges the player to remember a sequence of colors. The game displays a sequence of colored buttons, and the player must replicate the exact sequence by clicking on the correct buttons. The game continues until the player makes a mistake.

## How to Play
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. The game will display a random sequence of colors.
3. Click the buttons in the exact same order as the sequence.
4. As you correctly match each sequence, the game moves to the next level, adding one more color to the sequence.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and your score (highest level achieved) will be displayed.
6. Press any key to restart the game and try to beat your highest score.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the game.
- **CSS**: For styling the game buttons and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic of the game and user interactions.

## Game Features
- **Randomized Sequence**: The game generates a random sequence of colors each time a new level is reached.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The sequence length increases as you progress through the levels.
- **Flash Effects**: Buttons flash when they're activated by the game or the player.
- **Game Over Screen**: The game shows the current score and highest score after the game ends.

## Code Explanation

### HTML
- The HTML structure consists of a container that holds four color buttons (green, yellow, red, and blue).
- The game’s heading and instructions are displayed at the top, along with a `keypress` event to start the game.

### CSS
- The buttons are styled with a consistent size and color for each one.
- The `.flash` and `.flashGreen` classes provide visual feedback by changing the button’s background color when pressed.
- When the game ends, the background flashes red to indicate a game over.

### JavaScript
- **Game Variables**: The game maintains an array of colors (`colors`), the sequences of colors generated by the game (`gameSeq`), and the sequence entered by the player (`playerSeq`).
- **Event Listeners**: The game listens for both keyboard events (to start the game) and button click events (for player inputs).
- **Game Logic**: 
  - When the game starts, the game sequence is built by adding random colors to the array.
  - The player needs to repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding colored buttons.
  - If the player enters the correct sequence, the game progresses to the next level. If incorrect, the game ends and shows the final score.

### Functions
- **gameFlash**: Adds a flash effect to buttons when the game generates them.
- **playerFlash**: Adds a flash effect when the player clicks on a button.
- **levelUp**: Advances the game to the next level by adding a new color to the sequence.
- **btnClicked**: Handles player clicks, adds the button pressed to the sequence, and checks if the player’s input is correct.
- **check**: Compares the player’s sequence with the game’s sequence and determines if the game should continue or end.
- **reset**: Resets the game after a mistake.

## Game Controls
- **Start the game**: Press any key on the keyboard.
- **Replay the game**: After a game over, press any key to restart.

## Game Over and Restart
When you make a mistake, the game will show the current score (the level you reached) and your highest score. The background will flash red, and you will be prompted to press any key to restart the game.
